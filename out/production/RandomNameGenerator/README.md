# RandomNameGenerator
Generate a random name based on your interests.

A small generator to help you choose your babies' names! If you have any preferences, which I'm sure you do, filter
it however you like by first letter, rank, number of letters, year, and of course gender.

So? Let's go take a look at some names!

List of babies' names are taken from [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/names/babies-first-names/babies-first-names-summary-records-comma-separated-value-csv-format).
